\section{Introduction}
\label{sec.intro}

\subsection{Purpose} 
The purpose of the Joint Laboratory for Extreme Scale Computing (JLESC) is to be an international, virtual organization whose goal is to enhance the ability of member organizations and investigators to make the bridge between Petascale and Extreme computing, following the model of the Joint Laboratory on Petascale Computing (JLPC). The founding partners of the JLESC are Inria and UIUC.  JLESC will also involve computer scientists, engineers and scientists from other disciplines and from industry, to ensure that the research facilitated by the Laboratory addresses science and engineering's most critical needs and takes advantage of the continuing evolution of computing technologies.

\subsection{Term and Termination} 
The JLESC will last four (4) years, from the date of signature of the agreement (June 2014). After the original time period, the agreement can be renewed if the majority of full partners agree by  written amendment. The Agreement may only be revised by written consent of the Founding Partners.
The Agreement may be terminated at any time by the Founding Partners mutual consent in writing. Alternatively, a Partner that wishes to terminate its participation in the JLESC will provide ninety (90) days' notice of such termination.

\subsection{Objectives} 
The objectives of the JLESC are to initiate and facilitate international collaborations on research and state of the practice topics, related to computational and data focused simulation and analytics at scale. The JLESC will facilitate the production of original ideas, publications, discussion forums, research reports, products and open source software, aimed to address the most critical issues in advancing from petascale to extreme scale computing.

\subsection{Research Topics, Activities and Joint Projects} 
JLESC research topics include: parallel programming models and libraries, numerical algorithms and libraries, parallel I/O systems and libraries, data analytics, graph algorithms, heterogeneous computing, resilience, system and application performance analysis and modeling, storage infrastructure design and efficiency and productivity tools.  Research topics may evolve over the course of the JLESC existence.
JLESC Joint Projects are defined and tracked by the JLESC.  A joint project will have at least two co-Principal Investigators, each from the different JLESC partner institutions involved in the project, a statement of goals for the project, a program of work, and a  schedule to accomplish the goals.  

The activities funded by JLESC will include:
\begin{compactenum}
\item A 2 to 3-days workshop every six months with all JLESC partners. The purpose of these workshops is to discuss the work performed in the joint projects during the last six months and to jointly plan work for the next six months. 
\item Researcher/student exchanges. These exchanges take the form of short and long term visits (from days to 1 year or more) between staff and students of JLESC institutions, at different JLESC partner sites, in order to work on joint projects. If required by host institution, separate agreements will be signed between the visiting and host institution specifying the terms of the exchange.
\end{compactenum}

It is expected the number of staff participating and the degree of contributions will be approximately the same across all partner institutions.

\subsection{Partnership}
JLESC will have three levels of partners: Founding Partners, Full Partners and Associate Partners.   
The Founding Partners are Inria and UIUC and are considered as initial Full Partners. 

Full Partners participate in the JLESC management, have the ability to attend workshops and JLESC functions; will pose and co-lead collaborative workshops, will commit certain levels of funding to the JLESC collaboration for specified time periods; will contribute to setting the priorities of JLESC; and will provide access to facilities at their institution (if available).  
Associate Partners are those entities who intend to become Full Partners but are not yet meeting the obligations of full partnership as described in this document.  
The maximum period an institution can be an Associate Partner is twelve months.  After that period, the institution either reaches full partnership or leaves the JLESC. The Founding Partners may agree to extend the period of associate partnership with good cause.
In order to retain active status as a JLESC partner, institutions must fully participate in JLESC activities. Any institution that has not fully and actively participated in at least two JLESC activities over an eighteen (18) month span will be considered for having its partnership revoked. 

The current members of the JLESC are:
\begin{compactenum}
\item UIUC/NCSA (Founding partner)
\item Inria (Founding partner)
\item ANL (Full partner)
\item BSC (Full partner)
\item JSC (Full partner)
\item Riken (Full partner)
\end{compactenum}

\subsection{Funding Model}
Each Full Partner institution will provide funding dedicated to support the two types JLESC activities described above. The mechanism is that each partner institution allocates an annual budget that is managed locally (for ease of administration) both by the local representative and the JLESC director.  Each Full Partner's contributions dedicated to JLESC activities will be approximately equal in value.  Collaboration effort costs, staff costs, or in-kind costs are not considered dedicated funding.  
Full Partnership will be executed by signing the statement in Attachment A and recording it with the Founding Partners.  Attachment A states the new Full Partner undertakes the rights and obligations of the agreement.  The new partner is considered a Full Partner when Attachment A is signed by an authorized representative of the new partner and the chairman of the JLESC steering committee.  
Due to the US Department of Energy Policy, the Founding Partners agree to a one time exception for Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). 

ANL's Full Partnership membership is based on a letter of commitment from Dr. Marc Snir to carry out all Full Partner responsibilities as an employee of ANL and as defined in this agreement, including equivalent funding of JLESC activities and responsibilities.
The level of JLESC funding from each Full Partner will be set by agreement of the Founding Partners.
Associate Partners shall allocate an annual budget that is managed locally and controlled both by the local representative and the JLESC director, but would be less than the funding levels provided by Full Members. 
Associate Partners may also directly cover the full cost of their staff participation in JLESC activities, including paying participation fees for attending JLESC activities. In the latter case, the levels of funding should be sufficient for equivalent participation in the JLESC activities.  Collaboration costs, staff costs, or in-kind costs are not considered in determining an equivalent value.  Associate Partnership will be indicated by providing a "letter of commitment" to participate in JLESC activities to the extent the partner adds observable value to the JLESC.
For visiting activities, whatever is the selected funding model, a researcher from institution A, visiting institution B will only be supported by funds provided by institutions A and B. 
Each party involved in the collaboration will cover its personnel salaries and associated costs. The home institution(s) of the director shall cover the director's salary.
There will be approximately one-year overlap of the JLPC agreement between NCSA and Inria and the JLESC agreement.  For the sake of this agreement, any remaining JLPC funding at the expiration of the JLPC agreement will transition to JLESC funding. 

\subsection{Intellectual Property}
Whenever and as often as possible, the partners will produce open publications and results, with the organizations participating in the collaborative effort jointly deciding on the intellectual property rights for the work carried out by the partners.  
For any results that require protection of Intellectual Property, the institutions participating in the development of that result will jointly resolve it between themselves by developing specific agreements for covering those activities and IP rights.

\subsection{Management and Governance} 
The Steering Committee will consist of the heads (or their representative) of the involved Full Partner institutions. The Steering Committee is responsible for the overall success of JLESC activities, for ensuring that the JLESC has sufficient participation from their respective institutions and for providing strategic guidance to the Director and Executive committee. 
The Steering Committee shall self-select a chairperson once a year. All decisions should be taken unanimously. If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, Founding Partners will determine the final decision amicably, in a spirit of cooperation and goodwill.

\end{compactenum}
\newline
\newline
The JLESC will have a Director reporting to the Steering Committee every year. The Director will be appointed for a 2 years term by the Steering Committee. The JLESC Director is responsible for working with partner institutions to manage the JLESC activities on a day to day basis and manage the JLESC funds.  The JLESC Director will provide a yearly report of JLESC activities and accomplishments to the Steering and Scientific Advisory Committees.
\newline
\newline
The current JLESC director is Franck Cappello from ANL.
\newline
\newline
The JLESC Executive Committee will consist of one JLESC representative of each full partner institution. The members of the Executive Committee will be designated by the Steering Committee and the JLESC Director will be chosen among them. The JLESC representatives are responsible for overseeing their institutions' collaborative efforts and for assisting the Director in stimulating and organizing activities and in creating the annual report. 
The Executive Committee will meet periodically as necessary to carry out their responsibilities. The Steering, Scientific Advisory and Executive Committees will meet at least once every year during the annual evaluation days.

\subsection{Facilities} 
An institution involved in JLESC will provide to JLESC visitors involved in collaborations (if available): office space and internet access, administrative support, and make all reasonable efforts to provide them access to its local High Performance Computing resources during their visit.

\subsection{New Members} 
Organizations may apply for JLESC membership by contacting the Director and submitting a self-nomination letter explaining the value the submitting organization will bring to the JLESC and the organization's commitment to participate as described in this document.  New partners will be approved by unanimous agreement of the founding partners. 

\section{Scientific Activities}
\label{sec.science}

\subsubsection*{Activity reports}

The next pages present the scientific activities conducted between July 2014 and June 2015.
Scientific activities are presented as activity reports of on-going collaborative projects.
Each report features 8 parts: 
\begin{compactenum}
\item Participants
\item Research topic and goals
\item Results for current year
\item Visits and meetings (done and planned)
\item Impact and publications
\item Person-Month efforts
\item Future plans
\item References
\end{compactenum}

\subsubsection*{Scientific collaborations}

Scientific collaborations cover the three main topics of the joint-laboratory: parallel programming, resilience and numerical libraries. Other activities have been started on system issues and, in particular, related to file systems, archive and graph partitioning.
Scientific collaborations are categorized under five types:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Ongoing collaboration (\ongoing): Collaborative research is active, visits have been made, there have been several meetings and for some activities results have been produced and impact is significant.
\item Starting collaboration \starting): Collaborators from both sides have been identified and collaborative research has just started. Visits have been made or are planned. There is no result yet.
\item Finished collaboration (\finished): The topic behind the collaboration has been explored and produced some results. Collaborators decided to continue in other directions. 
\item Blocked/stopped collaboration (\blocked): Such collaboration has not progressed over the past year some for reasons associated with the availability of software, data or people. Ultimately a blocked collaboration get stopped if no progress can be made.
\item Collaboration under exploration (\explore): Collaboration is not yet established. However activity has started and gave some impact. We put in this category, activities that are likely to become collaborative research.
